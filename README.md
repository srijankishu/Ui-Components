# React UI Components – InputField & DataTable

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases two reusable React components, styled with TailwindCSS and documented with Storybook:  

1. **InputField** – Flexible input component with multiple states, sizes, variants, and features.  
2. **DataTable** – Dynamic table component supporting sorting, selection, and responsive design.  

Both components are designed to be reusable, scalable, and production-ready.
